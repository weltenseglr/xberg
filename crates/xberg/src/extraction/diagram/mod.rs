//! Deterministic diagram recovery from vector sources.
//!
//! A vector diagram already contains its own graph. Boxes are closed outlines,
//! connectors are open strokes, and labels are text drawn on top. Nothing has to
//! be inferred from pixels, so the recovered graph is exact rather than
//! probabilistic, and it carries the styling that a detection model cannot
//! recover at all.
//!
//! Each front end turns one source format into the geometry-carrying
//! intermediates below; [`assemble`] turns those into a [`DiagramGraph`]. The
//! split is what lets [`svg`] and [`pdf`] share every matching rule while
//! agreeing on nothing but the intermediates, and what would let a third
//! format (DrawingML, EMF) join them without touching the matching at all.
