# Fails fast (no docker build required) when a Cargo workspace member under
# crates/ is neither COPYd into a docker/Dockerfile.* build stage nor
# explicitly stripped from that Dockerfile's copy of Cargo.toml via the
# `sed -i '/<crate>/d; ...' Cargo.toml` exclusion line.
#
# Regression guard for #325: `crates/ttf-parser-compat` was added as a
# workspace member but never added to any Dockerfile's COPY list, so cargo
# failed to load its manifest inside the Docker build context (which only
# contains the crates each Dockerfile explicitly COPYs) while every
# non-Docker CI leg — which checks out the full repo — stayed green.
